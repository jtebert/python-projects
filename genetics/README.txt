This Python project is and API or simulator for genetics.

Current functionality:
- Create single- and double-stranded DNA molecules with blunt or sticky ends
- Visualize DNA segments as a ladder
- Anneal double-stranded DNA into 2 single strands
- Ligate single- and double-stranded DNA segments
- Check if DNA strands are complementary
- Create a complementary strand to a single strand of DNA

Functionality in development:
- Cutting DNA with restriction enzymes
- Assessing overhangs on double-stranded DNA

Future functionality:
- Allow pairing of non-complementary sequences (error coding)
- Import DNA sequence from a file
- Further DNA operations (repair, recombination)
- Simulation of duplication with potential for mutation
- Change ligation functionality to not have to separate the entire helix
  (just look at the ends instead)
- Allow ligation in different orientations (different orders and rotations)
- Recombination of segments after cutting by restriction enzymes
- Analysis of DNA fragment size after restriction
- Working with multiple segments of DNA
- Plasmid/circular DNA molecule support (includes self-ligation)
